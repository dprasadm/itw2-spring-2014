Assignment 1
-------------
Information of a registered user is recorded in a master dictionary:
{user_id: (name, place, date_of_birth)}

A registered user's list of friends is represented as a tuple:
(reg_user_id, [ user_id_1, ..., user_id_n ]) where n >= 0

The messages posted by a user are grouped as follows:
(user_id, [msg_1, ..., msg_n]) where n >= 0

Each message has four components:
(message_id, text, sent_date, sent_time)

Implement the following procedures:
    get_friends(user_id)
    get_friends_of_friends(user_id)
    
    send_message(my_id, friend_id, msg)
    send_message_bulk(my_id, [friend_id_1, ..., friend_id_n], msg)

    get_messages_from_friend(my_id, friend_id)
    get_messaged_from_all_friends(my_id, friend_id)
    get_birth_day_messages(my_id)

    delete_message(my_id, msg_id)
    delete_messages(my_id, (msg_id_1, ..., msg_id_n)) where n >= 0  
    delete_messaged_from_friend(my_id, friend_id)


    
Assignment 2
--------------
A 2D Cartesian coordinate is represented as a tuple:
(x, y)

A vector is represented by two points:
(p1, p2) where p1 is a tuple (x1, y1) and p2 is also a tuple (x2, y2)

Implement the following procedures:
    length(vector)
    normalize(vector)
    dot_product(vector, vector)
    cross_product(vector)
